# Elm + Phoenix boilerplate

__NOTE:__ This represents Phoenix 1.3. It is finalised but has not been officially released yet. More information [here](https://gist.github.com/chrismccord/71ab10d433c98b714b75c886eff17357).

This is a setup for an Elm + Phoenix project, using webpack 2 for bundling and simple users with authentication.

This is supposed to be something like starter point not production boilerplate.
